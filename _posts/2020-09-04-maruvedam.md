<strong>Periyar International USA</strong> encourage kids to outgrow in speech modulation, to act, and demonstrate the ability of courage and equality. On the occasion of Periyar's 143rd birthday, we are introducing the mono acting event. The actor would represent one of the Dravidian leaders and outline their significant contribution to uplift the community. The actor may dress up as the leader, outline the contribution, end with a question, "Who am I" and the audience would find the leader's name or  the actor reveals the "Leader Name."
